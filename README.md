# Calender App
This is a simple calender app that I built using basic React (my first React project) with the goal of making it similar to Google Calender. This gives you the ability to:
- Add events to the calender
- Delete events from the calender
- Edit existing events
- Toggle between weeks

All information is stored in local storage, and at the moment, there is still quite a bit of work to be done regarding the UI and other functionality features.

In the future, I hope to be able to allow for multiple users by adding in something like Google Firebase, adding even more desirable functionality to this application.
